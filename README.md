# Okapi
**Okapi** is a batch editor with a difference. Match lines from
across thousands of files by regex, then edit them all in one place.
**Okapi** makes it easy to identify patterns in your data, then make
targeted changes in many files at once. Use your editor, then
just save and close, and **okapi** does the rest.
